                <p class="paragraph">
                    The word 'Photography' was derived from
                    the greek words <i>photo</i>, which means 'light',
                    and <i>graph</i>, which means to 'draw'.
                    Together creating <i>photography</i>, which means 'drawing with light'.
                    Drawing with light in a literal sense as
                    it is the creation of images by recording light.
                    Photography is utilized in art, film, video production,
                    magazines, or simply as a hobby.
